      <h3>Title</h3>
      <p><strong>Transition from a Fermi Liquid to a Mott Insulator through the Pseudogap Regime at Finite Temperature</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This project explores the nature of electronic correlations in systems undergoing a transition
        from a Fermi liquid to a Mott insulator, focusing on the emergence of the pseudogap regime
        at finite temperature. The study aims to understand how strong interactions and finite-temperature
        effects modify the spectral and transport properties across this crossover.
      </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Research Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Analyze the breakdown of kondo cloud in the vicinity of the Mott transition.</li>
        <li>Study the temperature dependence of the pseudogap and its relation to spectral weight transfer.</li>
        <li>Compare numerical and analytical results obtained from Unitary Renormalization and benchmark them with the well-established results in literature</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Methods and Tools</h3>
      <p>
        The analysis involves both analytical approaches and numerical simulations. Methods include
        Unitary Renormalization group, spectral function analysis, and numerical solvers
        for model Kondo Hamiltonians. The computational work is implemented primarily in <strong>Python</strong> .

    </div>
<div class="section">
      <h3>Current Progress</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding the Magnetic quenching by the Kondo cloud. How the Kondo cloud destroys with increasing temperature and using the URG technique developed by Prof Siddhartha Lal with his other PhD students and benchmark with the well-established result in literature.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Expected Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        We expect to understand the phase transition from the Fermi liquid to the Mott insulator through the pseudo gap phase at finite temperature .
        This technique will be universal and can be used to study other phase transitions at finite temperature . This will open a new paradigm in the field of condensed matter
        to explore in the future.
